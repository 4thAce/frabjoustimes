I have moved my creative blogging over to this blog, as you can see, with its fancy new Web 2.0 features. (Integrated comments, for instance.) I hope you'll like it.

I'll keep the past [archives](http://magahiz.com/frabjous/archives) online at the original site -- see the sidebar here if there is something you'd like to check out from the past four years or so.

At the same time, you'll notice that I'm starting a brand new [Wordpress-hosted](http://wordpress.com) blog at this time as well \"[Worlds in the Uppper Right Hand Corner](http://upperrh.wordpress.com),\" which will focus on my collection of maps on postage stamps.
