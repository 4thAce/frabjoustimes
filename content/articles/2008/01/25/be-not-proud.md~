<div class=\"kufirst\">each life</div>\r\n<div class=\"kumid\">vindicated</div>\r\n<div class=\"kulast\">in words of four letters</div>\r\n\r\n<br /><div class=\"note\"><a href=\"http://www.bartleby.com/105/72.html\">John Donne</a>\r\n<blockquote>The RNA language is written in \r\n<a href=\"http://3quarksdaily.blogs.com/3quarksdaily/2004/11/ode_to_the_code.html\">an alphabet of four letters</a> \r\n(A, C, G, U), grouped into words three letters long, called triplets or codons. Each of the 64 codons specifies one of 20 amino acids or else serves as a punctuation mark signaling the end of a message. That's all there is to the code. But a nagging question has never been put to rest: Why this particular code, rather than some other?</blockquote></div>
